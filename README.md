# Question 1
Write a Python code to generate a square wave with user-defined amplitude, frequency, and samples per second. The code should plot the generated waveform and save it to a CSV file with two columns: time and amplitude.

# Question 2
Write a Python code that mimics the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) calculator available at [https://circuitdigest.com/calculators/adc-analog-to-digital-convertercalculator](https://circuitdigest.com/calculators/adc-analog-to-digital-convertercalculator).

# Question 3
Create a Python package that facilitates basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two numbers. Upload this package to PyPI (Python Package Index). Provide the package name and its URL. Explain how to install and use the package.

# Question 4
Describe how the current through a resistor, denoted as I(R), depends on the resistor value, R, when the resistor is connected across a voltage source, V, in a practical setting.

# Question 5
In communication systems, explain the need to modulate a signal with a carrier. Write a python code to demonstrate OOK (On-Off keying) modulation and demodulation.
